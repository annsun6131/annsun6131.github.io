## Anna Savranska
My name is Anna. I am Ukrainian who came to the US two years ago and spent my junior and senior years of high school in Haddonfield, New Jersey. I love different kinds of music, play tennis, and sometimes do film photography.

Below there is my favorite food ever - Ukrainian borscht with pampushky (special kind of soup with baked bread)

During SWEN 101 I want to learn:
- Ways to work in groups effectively and organize the project development
- How to become a better Software Engineer and continue self-development
- Things to do to be prepared for job interviews/co-ops
